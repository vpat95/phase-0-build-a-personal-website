            <h1>Hi, I'm Vivek!</h1>
            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in the Flatiron School's Flex Software Engineering Program. I graduated from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with a degree 
                in Information Technology & Informatics. Upon graduating I began my role as a Technical Project Manager for a DevOps consulting team where I 
                became increasingly interested in the techincal work the engineers on my team were executing. After a little over a year as PM I decided to 
                undergo a career change by enrolling in Flatiron School's Software Engineering program and the rest is history!

            <h2>The Road So Far:</h2>
            <p>The prework itself was an extensive but necessary set of lessons which will lay the foundation of what's to come. I have learned the basics of 
                Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will give a high level breakdown of the road so far.
